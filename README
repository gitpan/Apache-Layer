NAME
    Apache::Layer - Layer content tree over one or more others.

SYNOPSIS
        #httpd.conf
        PerlTransHandler Apache::Layer

        # anywhere you can configure a location
        <Location /project/images>
            PerlSetVar apache_layer_location /project/images
            PerlSetVar apache_layer_path     /dir1/root;/dir2/root
        </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to allow multiple content trees to be
    layered on top of each other within the Apache server.

    I developed this module because we produce lots of web sites
    where a high proportion of the site content is common. But where
    specific pages / images are tailored to the specific project.
    This module allows us to layer a sparse directory tree on top of
    the main complete tree without requiring redirects.

    The essence is that it will cause Apache to deliver content from
    a series of directories in turn.

    In some ways Apache::Layer is similar to Apache::Stage however
    it does not require redirects.

COMMON PROBLEMS
    Apache::Layer is relatively simple. The most common problem is
    not setting the apache_layer_location parameter correctly. As a
    rule this parameter should ALWAYS match the parameter within the
    location i.e. <Location /parameter>.
